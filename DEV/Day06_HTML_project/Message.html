    <h1>Head Master’s Message : The Asian School</h1>
    <p>“The quote by American psychologist Carl Rogers, ‘The only person who is educated is the one who has learned how to learn …and change’, holds more relevance today than ever before. In this era of the ‘new normal’, educators strive to equip students with the ability to adapt and learn continuously.

I began my journey with the school during the unprecedented lockdown period, when traditional classroom settings were replaced by remote learning. The team at Asian School is dedicated to ensuring that education reaches students even in the confines of their homes.

We believe in incorporating the traditional three Rs of education – Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic – alongside the new three Rs of Rethink, Realign, and Redesign. This is not just theoretical, but a practical approach that our teachers employ on a daily basis to ensure quality education in changing times.”</p>
