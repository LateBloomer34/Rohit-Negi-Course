inline css has heighest priority
=> but internal and extreal depends on its position.
-----if internal css write before external , extreanl has more priority 

--- if external css write before internal , intreanl has more priority.


// if we want internal or external render in ui, then put !imprtant with every proprty in internal and external

 h1{
            background-color: pink !important;
        }

!importan t overwrite the priority


example 1- 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <style>
        h1{
            background-color: pink;
        }
        </style>
here internal has priority over external CSS



example 2- 

    <style>
        h1{
            background-color: pink;
        }
        </style>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
here external has priority over internal CSS
// ordering matters only

means it totally depend on order, which comes later . has heighest priority.

same thing happen with tag , class and id
id has the heighest priority. class - second heighets , tag has least priority

ex- 
<h1 class="first" id="idfirst"> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</h1>

if we apply seperate bg colour for tag , class and id, always id colour render,
means ID has the heighest priority.

what happen if we apply property in only tag and class -  class property will render in the UI.



this priority rule knoem as cascading effect,
