 browser only understand JS syntax 

 interprator - line by line executor.


 chrome browser understand JS code using V8 engine, and this v8 engine is written in c++;
 so how v8 engine understand this c++ code, is there any compiler available.

 ans- there is no c++ compiler present inside the v* engine ,this c++ code written in the form of machine code and v* engine easily understand this code. 


 different machine code for different machines, and different OS(eg for 32 bit , for 64 bit).

 node JS adds this v8 engine for entire machine.
